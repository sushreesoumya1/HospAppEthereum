<b>Hospital App: </b><br/><br/>

<b>Abstract/Summary:</b><br/>
If you have ever visited a hospital like Apollo Hospitals Enterprise Limited, you know the importance of the patient database. <br/>
With the exponential increase in the amount of data being produced, it has become essential to secure the data.<br/>
Blockchains offer a solution to this problem by allowing us to store/transfer the data around the world without the need for a middle-man,<br/> 
while ensuring that sensitive patient data is kept safe.


<br/><br/><b>Actors:</b><br/>
In this demo application, I have taken a single actor, i.e. <b>the admin</b> who'll enter the patient data.<br/>

<br/><br/><b>Use case:</b><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp; The admin registers the patient data.<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp; The data can be viewed by the admin at any point of time.

<br/><br/><b>Rules:</b><br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp; Once registered, the patient data cannot be deleted.
